# ACIBA: Constructing a novel *Acinetobacter baumannii* Dataset and Molecular characterization of Antimicrobial determinats 
*Acinetobacter baumannii* is an ESKAPE (*Enterococcus faecium*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Acinetobacter baumannii*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Enterobacter* species) pathogens that causes community – acquired infections in patients with immunodeficiency, especially for long-term hospitalized patients.

In this study, we presented ACIBA datasets, containing draft assemblies, antimicrobial genes (AMR), virulence factors, multi – locus sequence types (MLST) and mobile genes elements (MGEs). Data analysis was performed from raw data collected from public databases based on available bioinformatics analysis tools. Additionally, the susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of several antibiotics against *A. baumannii* strains are available.
